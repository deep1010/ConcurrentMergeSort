Problem Statement:
.1)
 -> Given a number n and n numbers, sort the numbers using Merge Sort.
 -> Recursively make two child processes, one for the left half, one for the right half. If the number of elements in the             	  array for a process is less than 5, perform a selection sort.
 -> The parent of the two children then merges the result and returns back to the parent and so on.
.2)
 -> In place of processes use threads in the above problem.
